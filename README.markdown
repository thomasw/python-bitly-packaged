# python-bitly

python-bitly is a Python API wrapper for [Bit.ly](http://bit.ly/). It was created by Yoav Aviram. This project is a fork of Yoav's [python-bitly on Google code](http://code.google.com/p/python-bitly/) that adds a setup.py file.

If the maintainer of python-bitly adds a setup.py file in the future, this repository will probably be removed.
